    <h1>Welcome to Fitment Foundry</h1>
    <p>
      Fitment Foundry is a specialized remote workforce composed of passionate car people — the kind who know the difference between an EG and an EK, who dream about engine swaps, and who actually enjoy digging through compatibility spreadsheets.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      We provide e-commerce and catalog businesses with a reliable extension of their internal teams. Whether it’s ensuring accurate ACES/PIES data, building fitment applications, or QA'ing a massive part catalog before launch, we help brands serve car enthusiasts better by being car enthusiasts ourselves.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Most catalog and data work is handled by people who don’t understand cars — which leads to errors, mismatched applications, and frustrated buyers. We’re here to change that by building cleaner, enthusiast-informed data that actually makes sense.
    </p>

    <h2>Want to Work With Us?</h2>
    <p>
      We’re always open to partnerships with like-minded brands or businesses who want to clean up their catalog game. Shoot us a message and let’s make it happen.
